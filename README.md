not OS X as Oculus has discontinued support) and make sure your screen
configurations are right (change system display settings to
change. Google for more info).
- Use the RiftConfigUtil tool to make sure your
Oculus device is working properly on your computer.
- To run the game in Oculus download a firefox nightly build and install the
Mozilla WebVR Plus plug-in.
- Finally, Host the directory with
your favorite local server on FirefoxNightly.
- The index.html file should automatically display and the screen should
track headset motion. Click the VR bottom on the bottom right to
